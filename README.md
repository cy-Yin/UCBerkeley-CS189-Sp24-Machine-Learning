# UCBerkeley-CS189-Sp24-Machine_Learning

This repository contains all the materials of the course "Introduction to Machine Learning" in the UC Berkeley CS189/289A in the semester of spring 2024, including the discussions, exams and my solutions of all the 6 homework (hw2 does not involve and coding part).

One can find the course website [here](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/189s24/).

Since some datasets in the homework are too large to upload to GitHub, I will not upload the datasets in this repository. However, you can find the datasets in the course website, which have the suffix as follows:
```
*.npy
*.npz
```
